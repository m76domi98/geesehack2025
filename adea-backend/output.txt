Welcome to today's podcast! Let's dive into an exciting topic.


Viewed from space, Earth offers very few clues about the diversity of life forms that can be found
there. The first forms of life on Earth are thought to have been microorganisms that existed for
billions of years before plants and animals appeared. Mammals, birds, and flowers are all relatively
recent additions to the planet, originating 130 to 200 million years ago. Humans have only inhabited
this planet for the last 2.5 million years, and only in the last 200,000 years have humans started
looking like we do today.
